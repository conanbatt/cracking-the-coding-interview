# Challenges


## Computer Science & Competitive Programming

1. Build an LRU Cache. Get detailed requirements at https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

2. Lowest Common Ancestor at https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

3. Write an algorithm to flatten an Array, and one to flatten an object. (turn all keys into top level keys)

## Code Design

Coding design challenges prompt the candidate to navigate ambiguity and general implementational knowledge. Solutions can be evaluated in usefulness, coding fluency and communication. 

1. Design and Implement a command line's argument parser. The parser should allow named and unnamed parameters and parameter validation.

2. Resolve [FindParent](https://silverdev.notion.site/Challenge-FindParent-59672103482c4675be9ba6b532241785?pvs=4)
   
3. Design and Implement a Rate Limiter Middleware. The rate limiter receives a Req object, and can return if the response should be rate limited or not. Consider concepts like client retries, tolerance, and caching when designing this component.


## Modeling and API Design

1. Design & Implement a Banking Service. The service should allow to make accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and account transfers

2. Design an API version of Whatsapp. Write pseudocode to explain what each endpoint would execute.
