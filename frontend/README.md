## React Learning Materials

The most comprehensive course of React is [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) by Kent Dodds.

The video course has a 200U$S cost for Argentina. 
The exercises and some level of explanation are freely available on the repositories listed below. The content is encouraged for all levels of Frontend Engineering. 

```
Exercises are trivial if you know them, and the knowledge gap closes when they are not.
Strongly recommend doing all of them for all levels of Engineering.
