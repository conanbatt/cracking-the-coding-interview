# Behavioral Interviews

In any interview process candidates are evaluated for their soft skills - communication, storytelling, experience leading and working in teams, conflict resolution and more.

A behavioral screening can be as short as 15 minutes, though experienced candidates are expected to have great content to share to stretch an interview to 45 minutes.

A framework on how to think about this is provided in the draft podcast episode [Narrativa Personal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CNtLDbGMUmeQjKmmOZuxB4GF0pUe7zxyWy51BT1pTEY/edit#heading=h.4kuthmkwi01w).
