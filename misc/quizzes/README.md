# Quizzes

Quizzes or "Popcorn questions" are an interview style of asking multiple questions around key concepts in a technology, stack or computer science.

Quizz questions are meant to be answered in a few sentences. A good answer presents a correct definition of the concept or question. Beware of using code examples to explain concepts, as they usually mean you do not understand it.

Review each quizz and make sure you understand the underlying concept and you are effective in explaining it.
