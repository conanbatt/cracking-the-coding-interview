## Resources for practice

 [EdClub's Typing Jungle](https://www.edclub.com/sportal/program-3.game) is a web platform designed to help users enhance their typing speed and accuracy

 Hereâ€™s a guide to help increase your typing speed to over 70 words per minute (WPM).


### Step 1 - Assess Your Current Typing Speed

Initial Speed Test: Use [Ratatype](https://www.ratatype.com/) to take a speed test and assess your current typing speed and accuracy. This will give you a baseline to measure your progress against.

### Step 2 - Planify your Practice
  - Knowing your starting point planify your practice to get to 70WPM
  - Going from 35/40 WPM to 70 WPM can require more than 100 hours of practice.
  - As it doesn't require too much from your brain you can squeeze some minutes of practice between work meetings or free time you have around your day. 

### Step 3 -  Practice
  - You will improve your typing speed by typing. Repetition is the secret to improving speed and accuracy. Try to avoid any magical trick to improve speed or efficiency. Typing more and more frequent is the secret for improving your speed.
  - **[EdClub Typing Jungle](https://www.edclub.com/sportal/program-3.game)** will help you improve by playing.
    - The game not only focuses on typing. It also helps with your seat and stand position while typing. Will tell you interesting stories to keep you engaged while learning.
    - In order to reach 70 WPM you will need to clear around 600 games or lessons.
      - From lesson 1 to 418 you will practice the different character keyboard rows , the number row and its symbols.
      - From lesson 419 to 600 you will be bulding up speed and learning some tricky words. (You can start here if you already type without looking at the keyboard)
      - If you want to go further, from lesson 600 to the end you will build up speed to reach 75 to 80 WPM.
  - Practice While Working: An extra point I will recommend is to apply your typing skills to everyday tasks, such as coding, emailing or document writing, to reinforce muscle memory.
  - While EdClub primarily focuses on regular typewriting practice, [SpeedTyper.dev](https://www.speedtyper.dev/) focuses on improving your coding speed and provides practice in multiple languages.
