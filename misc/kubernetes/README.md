# Kubernetes

K8s is the most common orchestration system, and is often used and tested for devops and backend roles.

## Source Materials

Estimated prepping time for certification: +60 hours
- The [Linux Foundation course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-developers/) is the most legitimate course out there. The Linux Foundation runs several certifications like CKAD. The course content is good but the format is not great. Costs 299$ but often has steep 40% discounts.
- [Killer.sh](https://killer.sh/) this is a K8s certification training platform. The challenges are significantly harder than the real test - if you pass it here, you *will pass the test*. Great for hands on practice, not for learning the source content.
- [Kubernetes Essentials](https://www.educative.io/path/kubernetes-essentials) from educative.io. A step-by-step with progress solution. 35$/mo for Argentina.
