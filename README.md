## Silver.dev - Candidates ##

Silver.dev expects coaching candidates to work the entire stack of problems in the Cracking the Coding interview section.
Depending on your role, additional problems will be added to the platform based on real interviews, and for practice.

For candidates applying to specific companies, we sometimes require proof of skill before submission to clients. Refer to each company job listing for details
