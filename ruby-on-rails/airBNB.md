# AirBNB MVP

The MVP should support:

- CRUD Listing operations
    - Listings include availability.
- CRUD Booking operations
    - A booking affects a listing availability

**We expect you to**

1. Build functionality progressively - one feature at a time - and get as far as possible
2. The application is functional
3. It has an interface - an API for Backend engineers and a UI for fullstack engineers

**Tips**

1. The difficulty of this problem is how to handle availabilities.
    1. This is a hard problem - start with a simple solution first.
    2. Think deeply about the problem itself before coding it.
