# Ruby on Rails

Rails interviews are often practical applications that are intended to show knowledge in the frameowork and its idioms.

The expecation in a 1-hour interview is to be able to build an API or a simple web application from scratch, and show understanding of ActiveRecord and modeling, the MVC scaffold, and general problem solving, debugging and coding fluency.

The challenges in this section are meant to be used for live coding sessions, and to be completed functionally and elegantly within 50 minutes. Your environment must be ready to be used as soon as the interview starts.
