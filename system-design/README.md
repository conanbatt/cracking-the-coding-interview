# Study materials

The educative.io course [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-modern-system-design-interview-for-engineers-managers) is one of the best materials for prepping for system design interviews.

It includes the basic theory and a large amount of designs to go through and understand them. The content is *paid* but tremendously useful.

A good source for prepping is https://bytebytego.com/ as well.
